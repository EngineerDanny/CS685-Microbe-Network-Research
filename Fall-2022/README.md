**TIMELINE AND SHEDULES** 
---

- **Week 1**  : Review the main [research paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.05.001). Make an initial literature review and powerpoint presentation from the paper.

- **Week 2**  : Minor preview of the available correlation-based methods like SparCC, CCLasso, REBACCA, Correlation-Centric Network Command line tool and                   MENAP online tool. Find their corresponding R-packages (If they exist) and state the principle that they operate on.   

- **Week 3**  : Research on existing R packages available on CRAN, Github or Bioconductor that implement the conditional-dependence methods like SPIEC-EASI, MDiNE, MixMPLN, COZINE, etc

- **Week 4**  : Get all the publicly available microbiome composition datasets and make a table from it with columns, `Data name` , `Package` , `Source` , `Citation` , `No of Samples` and `No of Taxa`

- **Week 5**  : Review the SPIEC-EASI conditional-dependence method. Write a literature review of the [main paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004226) and assess it with the state-of-the-art methods like the Standard Pearson Correlation, SparCC and CCREPE.

- **Week 6**  : Test the existing R packages that implement conditional dependence.
