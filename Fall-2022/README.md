**TIMELINES AND SHEDULES** 
---

- **[Week 1](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-1)**  : Review the main [research paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.05.001). Make an initial literature review and powerpoint presentation from the paper.

- **[Week 2](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-2)**  : Minor preview of the available correlation-based methods like SparCC, CCLasso, REBACCA, Correlation-Centric Network Command line tool and MENAP online tool. Find their corresponding R-packages (If they exist) and state the principle that they operate on.   

- **[Week 3](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-3)**  : Research on existing R packages available on CRAN, Github or Bioconductor that implement the conditional-dependence methods like SPIEC-EASI, MDiNE, MixMPLN, COZINE, etc

- **[Week 4](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-4)**  : Get all the publicly available microbiome composition datasets and make a table from it with columns, `Data name` , `Package` , `Source` , `Citation` , `No of Samples` and `No of Taxa`

- **[Week 5](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-5)**  : Review the SPIEC-EASI conditional-dependence method. Write a literature review of the [main paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004226) and assess it with the state-of-the-art methods like the Standard Pearson Correlation, SparCC and CCREPE.

- **[Week 6](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-6)**  : General review of all the papers and make a table with columns `Method`, `Research Paper`, `Algorithms Compared` and `How they compare`.

- **[Week 7](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-7)**  : Write code for the **LASSO** method in Python or R for  matrix completion using the American Gut Data set.

- **[Week 8](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-8)**  : Implement the **LASSO** method considering all the columns(p different models). For every iteration, predict one column(y) and make the other columns features(X). Then find the `average test error` for each of the `number of samples`.

- **[Week 9](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-9)**  : Implement the **Pearson Correlation** method. Plot a graph demonstrating the `test error` against the `number of samples`.
 
- **[Week 10](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-10)**  : Compare the **LASSO** algorithm with the **Pearson Correlation** method. Plot a graph to show which of the methods is accurate.

- **[Week 11](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-11)**  : Regularize the **Pearson Correlation Model** to find the optimal hyper-paramter(s) to use. Different ways of training the **Pearson Correlation Model**(Type 2 ?). 

- **[Week 12_13](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/tree/main/Fall-2022/week-12)**  : Log-transformation and scaling of whole datasets. Testing different scaling methods for this sparse datasets. Running algorithm/mult-column test-error script for different real datasets.
