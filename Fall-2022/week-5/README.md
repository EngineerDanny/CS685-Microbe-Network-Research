## Literature Review of Sparse and Compositionally Robust Inference of Microbial Ecological Networks

### Background
**SPIEC-EASI** is a statistical method which aims at inferring microbial ecological networks. It infers these networks from amplicon sequencing datasets. Abundances of the Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) are composed of several elements. This makes using traditional methods like correlation to infer networks lead to false results. With Microbial sequencing-based studies, only a few OTUs are measured on several samples. This makes additional information or assumption very essential for inference of microbial networks accurately. SPIEC EASI is a conditionally dependent method which assumes that ecological networks are sparse.
