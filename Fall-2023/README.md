## Next steps in my research is to review some of the papers related to difference network models

The analysis presented in this paper is designed to test for differences in co-occurrence patterns at the community level across ecosystems, identify modules of co-occurring microorganisms within communities, and identify pairwise co-occurrence patterns within modules that are consistent across ecosystems.

### Testing for Differences in Co-Occurrence Patterns at the Community Level
To test for differences in co-occurrence patterns between microbial communities from different ecosystems, we generated a dissimilarity matrix consisting of Spearman correlation coefficient distances (1-correlation coefficient) representing co-occurrence between all pairs of microorganisms from each sample (Figure 1C) using the bioDist package (Ding et al., 2014). The calculation of these distances produces a matrix where microbial taxa rather than samples were compared to one another. This Spearman's distance matrix represents the strength of correlation among microbial pairs; thus smaller distances represent stronger correlations, which were visualized using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS; Figure 1E). We used a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA; 9999 permutations) (Anderson, 2001) from the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2013), with ecosystem type (apple flower, bodies, or soils) representing our independent variable to test for differences in co-occurrence patterns at the community level based on the Spearman's distance matrix.
