**TIMELINES AND SHEDULES** 
---

- **Week 1**  : Organize the code and results on monsoon and Github.

- **Week 2**  : Usage of R2 score/RMSE instead of MSE (since it is more widely used and understandable for the microbiome/soil people).
                Add a scatterplot of predicted vs actual label values in the train and test sets useful to explain how the R2 is computed.
- **Week 3**  : Write Spearman's Rank Algorithm and compare it with the Featureless, Pearson and LassoCV.

- **Week 4**  : Research on how to use Mutual Information for prediction. Look into Network inference with Bayesian model as used by mLDM (2016).
